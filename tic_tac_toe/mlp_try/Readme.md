### MLP for ttt

Input: feature vector encoded by the 'String' columns x:2, o:1, -:0 

Model: 2 classfication branches (also treated the remoteness as a classification problem)

Issues: Accuracy of predicting remoteness is quite low compared to the prediction of value. Though the exceptions are still a lot because the remoteness is not right.



Only saved the parameters of the model and since it is really simple, the model is only 29KB. But exceptions are still large in space.
