# Database Compression Project: GamesCrafters

## Purpose

This project aims to develop a simple yet efficient formula that takes a game position as input and classifies it into one of several value-remoteness output classes for GamesCrafters. The overarching goal is to compress game databases without compromising the essential game state information.

## Objectives

1. **Training a Model & Assign a Value-Remoteness Classification**
    * **Requirements**:
      - Proficiency in Python/C
      - Basic Machine Learning and PyTorch knowledge
    * **Steps**: 
      1. Understand the prerequisites for model training using ML tools.
      2. Experiment with different classification models.
      3. Train the chosen model(s) with the game datasets.
      4. Test the model's accuracy against known outcomes.

2. **Design a New Exceptions Table**
    * **Requirements**:
      - Proficiency in Python/C
      - Basic Machine Learning and PyTorch knowledge
    * **Steps**: 
      1. Understand the specific model for various game datasets.
      2. Build upon existing exceptions table from previous semesters (delta value, calculation, etc.)
      3. Experiment with new ways to implement our exceptions table.
