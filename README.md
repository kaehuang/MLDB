# Database Compression Project: GamesCrafters

## Purpose

This project aims to develop a simple yet efficient formula that takes a game position as input and classifies it into one of several value-remoteness output classes for GamesCrafters. The overarching goal is to compress game databases without compromising the essential game state information.

## Objectives

1. **Generate Various Datasets on Different Games**
    * **Requirements**: 
      - Familiarity with GamesmanClassic
      - Proficiency in Python/C
    * **Steps**: 
      1. Initiate the game executable on GamesmanClassic.
      2. Solve the game on GamesmanClassic to gather all possible game states and outcomes.
      3. Use the analysis menu on GamesmanClassic.
      4. Explore different representations (string, hash, ternary, binary, etc.)
      5. Export data to a CSV file.
   
2. **Training a Model & Assign a Value-Remoteness Classification**
    * **Requirements**: 
      - Familiarity with Brainome/Trainable Machine/Tensorflow Playground
      - Proficiency in Python/C
      - Basic Machine Learning and PyTorch knowledge
    * **Steps**: 
      1. Understand the prerequisites for model training using ML tools.
      2. Experiment with different classification models.
      3. Train the chosen model(s) with the game datasets.
      4. Test the model's accuracy against known outcomes.
      5. Create an exceptions table.
